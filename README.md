# Rubik's Cube Solver

A **real-time Rubik’s Cube solving system** using **computer vision and algorithmic logic**. This project detects all cube stickers via a webcam feed, calculates the optimal sequence of moves using the **Kociemba algorithm**, and provides **augmented visual guidance** to solve the cube automatically.

## Key Features
- Detects all **54 stickers** of a standard Rubik’s Cube using **OpenCV, HSV color segmentation, and contour detection**.  
- Computes **optimal solving sequences** in under 30 moves with the **Kociemba two-phase algorithm**.  
- Provides **real-time move instructions** with augmented arrows overlaid on the live video.  
- Applies **image preprocessing techniques** like Gaussian blur, adaptive thresholding, and perspective transforms for robust detection under variable lighting conditions.
